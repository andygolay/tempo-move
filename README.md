# TempoStreamChannel for Movement Network

A port of [TempoStreamChannel](https://paymentauth.tempo.xyz/draft-tempo-stream-00) to Movement Network — a streaming payment channel escrow contract from the Tempo open standard.

## What is TempoStreamChannel?

A streaming payment channel that lets two parties (payer and payee) exchange payments off-chain using signed vouchers, with only a few on-chain transactions for the entire lifecycle:

1. **Open** — Payer deposits tokens into escrow
2. **Stream** — Payer signs vouchers off-chain authorizing cumulative payment amounts
3. **Settle** — Payee submits vouchers on-chain to claim funds (can batch many vouchers into one settle)
4. **Close** — Payee closes the channel, settling the final voucher and refunding the remainder to the payer

This means 50 API calls can be paid for with just 3 on-chain transactions (open, settle, close).

## Contract

**Existing testnet deployment address:** `0x3e9edf3be513781a6db0706b652da425ad67f58b5cb366847126bf0fb716fc58`

Entry functions: `open`, `settle`, `top_up`, `close`, `request_close`, `withdraw`

### Build and test

```sh
movement move compile --named-addresses tempo_stream=default
movement move test --named-addresses tempo_stream=default
```

24 unit tests covering the full channel lifecycle including ed25519 voucher signature verification.

### Deploy

```sh
movement init --network custom --rest-url https://testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1
movement move publish --named-addresses tempo_stream=default
movement move run --function-id 'default::channel::initialize'
```

## Examples

Three TypeScript scripts demonstrate different payment patterns on Movement testnet using the same contract. Each script generates fresh accounts, funds them from the testnet faucet, and runs a full channel lifecycle end-to-end.

### Setup

```sh
cd examples
pnpm install
```

### Run

```sh
pnpm run ai-api        # AI API pay-per-use
pnpm run subscription   # Monthly subscription streaming
pnpm run freelancer     # Freelancer milestone payouts
```

### 1. AI API Pay-Per-Use (`pnpm run ai-api`)

## How it works

```
Payer                          Payee                         On-chain
  |                              |                              |
  |-- open (deposit tokens) ---->|                         [1 tx: open]
  |                              |                              |
  |-- signed voucher #1 -------->|  (off-chain, free)           |
  |-- signed voucher #2 -------->|  (off-chain, free)           |
  |-- signed voucher #3 -------->|  (off-chain, free)           |
  |         ...                  |                              |
  |                              |-- settle (latest voucher) -->[1 tx: settle]
  |                              |                              |
  |-- signed voucher #N -------->|  (off-chain, free)           |
  |                              |                              |
  |                              |-- close (final voucher) ---->[1 tx: close]
  |                              |                              |
  |  <-- refund (unused deposit) |                              |
```

- **Vouchers** are BCS-serialized `{ channel_id, cumulative_amount }` signed with ed25519
- **Cumulative amounts** mean only the latest voucher matters — no double-spend risk
- **Grace period**: If the payer wants to close early, they call `request_close` and the payee has 15 minutes to settle any outstanding vouchers before the payer can `withdraw`
